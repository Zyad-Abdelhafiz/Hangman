## How The Game Works

- The game consists of 5 different questions, each with 4 possible answers.
- When the game is launched, the player will be prompted to choose one of the 10 questions to answer.
- Once a question has been answered correctly, the player's grade will be displayed and they will be prompted to choose another question.
- If a player chooses the same question that has already been answered correctly, the code will prompt them to choose a different question.
- The game will continue until the player has answered all 5 questions or wrote EXIT to Get the final score or wrote STOP to close the game.
